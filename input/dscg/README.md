# Feature Model of Trie-based Collection Data Structures

This archive contains a snapshot of a continuously evolving feature model description of the domain of trie-based collection data structures. The feature model is expressed in FDL, which is a Feature Description Language (van Deursen & Klint, 2002). We use an extension of FDL that adds an integer data type (int) to the model. 

For convenience of viewing, the [Rascal programming language](http://www.rascal-mpl.org) with its provided [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) environment supports syntax highlighting and experimental visualization of FDL diagrams.
