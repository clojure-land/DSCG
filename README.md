# DSCG: A Domain Specific / Data Structure Code Generator for Collections

The Data Structure Code Generator (DSCG) is an ongoing effort to encapsulate the commonalities and differences in abstractions and features of trie-based (immutable) collections. It aims to simplify the co-evolution of a product family of efficient data structures by applying generative programming techniques.

**NOTE: DSCG currently undergoes mayor rework and is currently unstable to use.**
